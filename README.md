# Income-Based-Housing-Affordability-Analysis-within-Nairobi-Region
This project integrates rental prices by zone, neighbourhoods and apartment size, income segmentation and commute costs to evaluate the housing affordability using the 30% income benchmark—helping Nairobi residents identify financially sustainable housing options based on their income. 
# Problem Statement
Rising rental prices in Nairobi have made it increasingly difficult for residents to secure housing that aligns with their income levels. Rental costs vary significantly by zone and apartment type (1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, etc.), yet many households lack clear income-based benchmarks to determine which neighborhoods are affordable within their limit.
Although lower-rent areas may seem affordable, they can come with higher commuting costs that offset rental savings. Conversely, centrally located neighborhoods may reduce transport expenses but demand higher rent  straining net income.
This analysis focuses on integrating rental prices, income segmentation and commute expenses to provides practical insights that support financially sustainable housing decisions.
# Objectives
To analyze how average rent varies across zones and apartment types (1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, etc.) in Nairobi.
To determine which neighborhoods are affordable for different income groups using net income benchmarks.
To assess the relationship between rental costs and commuting expenses in determining net housing affordability.
To compare average rent for 1-bedroom apartments across neighborhoods and zones.
# Data Analysis
The rental prices show a pattern with:
 Western Zone showing the highest rents across all apartment sizes.
 Northern Zone following as upper-mid tier.
 Eastern & Central Zones are mid-range.
 Southern Zone tends to be relatively lower.
The price widens significantly for 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom units.

# Data Analysis
Low-income and lower-middle-income groups are almost entirely excluded from most neighborhoods.
The upper-income group is the only segment able to afford the majority of neighborhoods and apartment sizes.
Middle-income households can afford housing in some neighborhoods, but their options are limited and focused in certain areas.

# Data Analysis
Kilimani , Lavington, Westlands and Runda  show relatively high rent above 100k a month but low to moderate commute cost .
Ongata Rongai, Thika and Ruai have relatively low rent but very high commute costs up to Ksh 6K+, indicating cheaper housing far from work or city centers.
Most neighborhoods have commute costs between  Ksh 2K to 4K,

# Data Analysis
Westlands is the neighbourhood with the highest monthly rent and Ruai with the lowest average rent.
Neighbourhoods within the Western regions have the highest rent concentration while the ones in the Eastern regions indicate lower average rent. 
Southern and Central Zones falls within the mid range.

# Conclusions
- Rental costs in Nairobi is highly determinant on the geographical location.
   The Western Zone records the highest rents across all apartment sizes.
   The Northern Zone follows as an upper-mid tier market.
   Eastern Zone sit in the mid-range.
   Central and Southern Zone generally reflects relatively lower rental prices.
- Rental prices increase sharply as apartment size moves from 1-bedroom to 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom units. This means households that require larger spaces must allocate a significantly higher portion of their income to rent, making affordability more challenging compared to those living in smaller units.
- Based on the **UN Housing Affordability Benchmark** that **Housing costs should not exceed 30% of gross household income**: 
   -Low-income and lower-middle-income groups are largely priced out of most neighborhoods- the ones they can afford is based on this rule is Githurai 44 and Ruai.
   -Middle-income earners can afford 1-bedroom units in most neighborhoods, except those located in the Western Zone. However, when considering 2- and 3-bedroom units, their affordable options become significantly limited and are largely concentrated within the Eastern Zone.
   -Upper-income earners are the only group with broad neighborhood and apartment-size flexibility.
- Neighborhoods such as Ongata Rongai, Thika, and Ruai show:
   Lower rental prices and significantly higher commuting costs (up to Ksh 6,000+)
- Areas such as Kilimani, Lavington, Westlands, and Runda show:
   Monthly rent of above Ksh 100,000 and low to moderate commute costs – suggesting in areas where the rent is premium there is reduced travel time and transport expenses. 
- Westlands records the highest average monthly rent for 1 bedroom unit, while Ruai records the lowest.
